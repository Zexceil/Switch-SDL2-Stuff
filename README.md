# Nintendo Switch-SDL2-Stuff
## What is this?
This is an example of SDL2 with C++ on the switch, you can use this as a template and I don't mind if you don't add me to credits;

I've made this so people can understand programming with SDL2 on the Nintendo switch easily and get into it more.

## Future stuff:

* Rotation.
* Animation.
* Implement audio loading and usage(Soon).
* Using TTF (True type fonts, text)
* Collision stuff.
* Main menus and etc.
